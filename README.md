# All the Swing Dancing
A Swing Dance event tracking web application

## Why?
Because I have a love of dancing, which pairs poorly with my ability to remember all the events happening within the dance community. My hope is to get this project to the point where others are also using this website for tracking and reviewing dance events. An event hub made by a dancer, for dancers. 

## How it began
It started as a project for The Iron Yard of Indianapolis, as a final project. 
I've since continued to use it as both a side-project and a personal playground for testing and implementing code ideas.
